There are 3 files the javascript.js file contains the below 5 examples:
Example 1: String Interpolation and Object Serialization: This example demonstrates how to use string interpolation in JavaScript, along with the JSON.stringify() method to serialize an object into a string.
Example 2: Object Mutation and Reference: This example shows how object mutation works in JavaScript and how object references are shared between variables.
Example 3: Array Mutation and Reference: This example illustrates array mutation and reference sharing behavior in JavaScript.
Example 4: Default Parameters and Rest Parameters in Functions: This example showcases the usage of default parameters and rest parameters in JavaScript functions.
Example 5: Asynchronous Code with setTimeout and Promises: This example demonstrates asynchronous programming in JavaScript using the setTimeout() function for a delay and the Promise object for asynchronous data retrieval.
The promise.js file contains:


Asynchronous Operation with Promises
This code snippet illustrates how to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript using Promises.

Description
The getData() function is defined to simulate an asynchronous task, such as fetching data from an API. Inside the Promise constructor, a setTimeout() function is utilized to mimic a delay of 5 seconds before resolving the Promise with an array containing a message.

```javascript

function getData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API)
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = ["this is my promise i will do it"];
            // Simulating successful completion
            resolve(data);
        }, 5000); // Simulating a delay of 5 seconds
    });
}
```
The getData() function returns a Promise object, which can be consumed using the .then() and .catch() methods. The .then() method is executed when the Promise is successfully resolved, while the .catch() method handles any errors that may occur during the operation.

```javascript

// Consuming the Promise
getData()
    .then(data => {
        console.log('Data received:', data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
    });
 ```
Usage
To use this code snippet:

Call the getData() function.
Chain the .then() method to handle the resolved data.
Chain the .catch() method to handle any errors.

```javascript

getData()
    .then(data => {
        // Handle the received data
        console.log('Data received:', data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Handle errors
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
    });
```
This code provides an effective way to manage asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, ensuring clean and readable code for handling asynchronous operations.

And .html file is just useless only for using this js files.
